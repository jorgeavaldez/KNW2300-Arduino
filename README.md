KNW2300-Arduino
===============

The code we're running on the Arduino for KNW 2300.

Basically, it just runs our motors and messes with the sensors. It's nothing fancy.

Requirements
============

Depends on the RXTXRobot jar available at http://lyle.smu.edu/fyd/downloads.php

Also requires the drivers for the Arduino Uno, also available at the above link.

Disclaimer
==========

I probably won't respond to pull requests if you submit them because this is for a class.
If you try to use this code, I don't know what to say, other than "bruh, you must be hella bored."
